      "Django is a full-stack \"batteries included\" framework that provides an ORM, admin panel, authentication, and templating out of the box. Flask is a microframework that gives you more flexibility to choose components. \n\nI typically choose Django for complex applications that need rapid development with standard features (like content management systems). For example, at my last company, we used Django to build an internal analytics dashboard that needed user permissions and database modeling quickly.\n\nI prefer Flask for microservices or APIs where I need lightweight performance. Recently, I built a high-performance image processing service in Flask that handles 500+ requests per second with minimal overhead. The key architectural difference is Django's convention-over-configuration approach versus Flask's modular design.",

      "My optimization approach follows a systematic process:\n1. **Profiling**: First I'd use cProfile and SnakeViz to identify bottlenecks\n2. **Metrics**: Implement Prometheus/Grafana to track memory usage, response times, and throughput\n3. **Database**: Check query performance with EXPLAIN ANALYZE and optimize indexes\n4. **Concurrency**: Evaluate threading vs multiprocessing vs async based on I/O bound vs CPU bound\n\nFor example, I recently optimized a Django ORM service that was taking 2s per request. By:\n- Adding database indexes (reduced query time by 60%)\n- Implementing caching with Redis (reduced load by 40%)\n- Converting heavy computations to Celery tasks\nWe achieved 200ms average response time and 300% higher throughput.",

      "For a high-traffic system, I'd recommend:\n1. **Decoupled Services**: Separate concerns (auth, payments, notifications)\n2. **API Gateway**: Kong/Traefik for routing and rate limiting\n3. **Event-Driven**: Kafka/RabbitMQ for async communication\n4. **Containerization**: Kubernetes with auto-scaling\n5. **Observability**: Distributed tracing with Jaeger\n\nAt [CompanyX], I led a migration from monolith to microservices that:\n- Used gRPC for internal service communication\n- Implemented circuit breakers with Hystrix\n- Achieved 99.99% uptime during Black Friday (10x traffic spike)\nThe key was gradual rollout with feature flags and canary deployments.",
